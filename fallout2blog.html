                    <p class="blog-post-meta">February 8, 2024</p>

                    <p>Fallout 2 was one of the first cRPG games I played way back in highschool. When I first booted up the game, I couldn't even beat the tutorial level without looking up
                        a leveling guide. This game came out in a different era of gaming, where handholding wasn't a thing and where the difficulty was brutal. But underneath all the rough exterior,
                         Fallout 2 offers an unparalleled RPG experience where player agency is at the top of the list.
                    </p>

                        <h4>The Story So Far</h4>
                        <p>Set 80 years after the events of the first game, Fallout 2 places players in the role of the Chosen One, a descendant of the original Vault Dweller. The player is tasked with 
                            finding the Garden of Eden Creation Kit (GECK) to save their village, Arroyo, from drought and famine. After completing the Temple of Trials, The Elder tells us to locate
                            a certain individual for knowledge about the GECK. We then set off the nearest location set in our pip-boy, a town called Klamath.
                        </p>

                    <section class="my-4">
                        <h4>Gameplay</h4>
                        <p>The game combines both real time exploration with turn based combat much like its predecessor. The game retains the isometric perspective and turn-based combat of the original, with several 
                            enhancements and additions. The player and enemies take turns according to their respective initiative. The S.P.E.C.I.A.L. (Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck) system remains central to character development, allowing
                            for a different role-playing options.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You'll be pleased to know that the game allows for a variety of build options. If you want to be the best gunslinger and diplomat in the wasteland,
                            you can assign skill points into Small Guns (or Big Guns) along with Speech. Or if you're tired of ranged builds, you can try your hand into Melee and Unarmed.
                            There's a motley mix of individualized styles that you can do, but there is a really <em>special</em> one that will really impact your progression and gameplay experience. 
                            More on this later.

                        <h4>Quests</h4>
                        <p>Just like any RPG, the game offers an extensive array of quests each with their own moral dilemmas and challenges. The main quest was made in such a way that it offers small tidbits
                            of clues to the real location of the GECK while offering players the chance to explore each new settlement they come across. While this is the natural progression of questing, Fallout 2
                            is more open ended with regards to exploration. Experienced players can just skip all the way down South California, do certain quests in certain locations and end up a dozen levels stronger with better gear.
                            Such is the freedom offered by the game.
                        </p>
                        <p>Players can also choose to lower their INT score below 4, effectively making them stupid. The game doesn't pull any punches when your're mentally deficient and doing so will
                            rob you of any potential quests rewards and experience. But dialogue as a stupid person is hilariously fun and comedic.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Difficulty</h4>
                        <p>Most modern players will actually find this game rather difficult to get into. The classic Fallouts were not known for being kind to noobs and this game offers no mercy.
                          This game is difficult, no exceptions, and the learning curve is even steeper. The tutorial dungeon is really easy compared to what's to come. Players may experience random
                          encounters when traveling, and they only get harder as they progress down the map. "Easy" encounters with enemies such as tribals and wolves are doable. It's the hardest ones such as
                          a pack of Deathclaws, Aliens, The Master's Remnants and other wasteland abominations that new players should be wary about. 
                        </p>
                        <p>But don't worry, you don't have to do it all alone (hopefully).Encounters are more balanced around having companions around, so it's a good idea to find some friends who'll 
                            take a bullet or two for you. Sulik and Cassidy are often top picks for any budding adventuring team.
                          </p>

                    <section class="my-4">
                        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                        <p>Fallout 2 is a masterclass in terms of writing, story, turn based combat and player agency. Not a lot of RPGs today can claim that you can become both a boxing legend and a pornstar
                            through regular gameplay but Fallout 2 isn't exactly your typical cRPG. It offers players total freedom with with their stat and skill allocation, allowing for total replayability through
                            build diversity. Going as far as letting your character become stupid, totally changing the gameplay experience. The games technical flaws have been fixed by official patches, now it runs 
                            like butter. If you want even more content, then the Restoration Project Mod is a good balance between lore friendly and new content.
