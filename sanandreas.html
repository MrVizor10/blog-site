                        <p>I once played San Andreas when I was way younger, around 6 or 7 years old. I could remember all the things that you could do in the open world,
                            such as stealing a military jet or just doing stunts in a bi-plane. It was hilarious and fun at the same time. But sadly, the fun would soon come to an end as my PS2 disk was abruptly taken by my mom. It was never seen again.
                            Maybe she thought it was too violent for kids? Anyways, I've come back to review the game in all its glory on Steam.

                        <h4>The Story So Far</h4>
                        <p>Set in the early 1990s, the game follows the journey of Carl "CJ" Johnson, who returns to his hometown of Los Santos after the murder of his mother. CJ finds himself drawn back into the world 
                            of gang violence, corruption, and betrayal as he tries to restore his family's former glory and uncover the truth behind his mother's death. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            San Andreas is an island that features three cities.  The game starts in Los Santos, inspired by Los Angeles, combining upscale downtown 
                            regions with the gang-dominated ghettos of South Central. San Fierro, modeled after San Francisco, captures the city's iconic hilly landscape and persistent fog. 
                            The third city, Las Venturas, mirrors early '90s Las Vegas, showcasing a strip lined with casinos and the surrounding desert landscape.

                        <h4>Gameplay</h4>
                        <p>For a game made in the early 2000's, San Andreas is incredibly feature rich in terms of content and map design. It does a lot of things right without making it seem too forced or
                            bloated for the game. The minigames are incredibly well done and offer a break from doing any missions. Just like in real life, practicing a skill would eventually lead to small 
                            improvements over time. Biking and working out, gives out bonuses to stamina, speed, as well as strength. Swimming improves lung capacity. Killing enemies improves your gun handling skill.
                            These systems offer the player a sense of reward and sensible progression while being nuanced as well.

                            <h5><em>Learning to fly</em></h5>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <section class="my-4">
                        <h4>Missions</h4>
                        <p>Just like in any GTA title, story progression is tracked by doing missions for certain individuals. The first few missions start you off easy, like learning graffiti art and 
                           shooting Ballas fools up.  Missions in game get progressively more challenging as time goes on, but on the flipside they get more badass. Except for that one train mission. 
                           Later missions are definitely more memorable. A couple of them are; infiltrating Area 51 to get a jetpack, learning to fly an airplane (or heli), and 
                           flying back to Vice City to assassinate some random mob boss.

                    <section class="my-4">
                        <h4>Soundtrack</h4>
                        <p>The game's soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard in a video game. It was here that I was first introduced to grunge through Radio-X, 
                            one of the game's many radio stations, and I've since fallen in love with the genre. San Andreas offers players the full spectrum of musical
                            tastes from country, hip-hop, classic rock down to reggae and dancehall music. If you're looking for some new stuff to add to your playlist, then
                            the game won't definitely disappoint you.
                        </p>

                    <section class="my-4">
                        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                        <p>Usually when a game tries to do a millions things at once, it often ends up being a dissappointing hodge-podge of gameplay elements that
                            break the cohesiveness of the title. Not for San Andreas fortunately. Game delivers in all the right places as expected of all Rockstar titles.
                            Count a normal playthrough to last anywhere between 40 to 60 hours, and that's just for the story alone. With its great story, terrific voice acting
                            , superb gameplay mechanics and mission design, San Andreas definitely deserves a spot as one of the best open world games Rockastar has produced.
