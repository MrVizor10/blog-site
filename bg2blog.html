                        <p>Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition can be counted as one of the most engaging cRPGs that I have ever played in my life. 
                            Released by the wizards over at BioWare in 2000, this game isn't just an RPG—it's a gaming icon
                             that will have you wanting more. Ready your swords and stock up on potions, because we're gonna be reviewing the behemoth
                              that is BG2!
                        </p>
                    </section>
                    
                    <div class="container mt-4 mb-4">

                    <section class="my-4">
                        <h4>The Story So Far</h4>
                        <p>You wake up in a dark dungeon, captured by the mysterious wizard Irenicus. You know nothing of his motives and plans, and staying trapped isn't an option.
                             The world really opens up from the tutorial dungeon, and from there it's an all-out adventure through Amn and it locale, filled with more plot hooks than a goblin's fishing kit.
                              Danger lurks in every corner, from the bustling, chaotic streets of Athkatla to the eerie, and often too brutal Underdark. Though this game is nearly 20 years old,
                              its writing and story offer a solid experience from start to finish.

                    <section class="my-4">
                        <h4>Gameplay</h4>
                        <p>The second game brings enhancements and a more thoughtful design; your actions now feel more focused and purposeful. In the first game, you spent a lot of time exploring seemingly
                             endless wilderness maps to find battles and earn enough experience points to level up and fight murderous kobold gangs and similar enemies. In this game, you accept a quest, 
                             go straight to its location, and immediately start battling powerful mages, negotiating with demons, and challenging vampire clans. The stakes are higher across the board, 
                             starting with an introductory-level adventure for beginners and progressing to much tougher quests for experienced heroes starting at level seven and above. This increased 
                             intensity is felt with every monster you defeat and every magical item you loot.</p>

                        <h4>Difficulty & Quests</h4>
                        <p>In many ways, this game feels more like a strategy game than a traditional RPG, especially by modern standards. Certain battles are incredibly difficult without using specific spells. 
                            I faced numerous challenges throughout the game, and it's impressive how many encounters require strategic thinking instead of simply attacking with a sword and casting magic missiles.
                            The later parts of the game ramp up in difficulty as new monster races and locations are thrown at you. Particularly troublesome are Beholders, as they can cast a flurry of devastating spells
                            like Cause Serious Wounds, Domination, Charm Person among many others.

                        <h4>Enhanced Edition Content</h4>
                        <p>The desktop version of the game remains largely unchanged, though it now supports higher resolutions and full-screen modes, which are not drastically different from the 1998 and 2000 
                            versions. Notably, Beamdog has announced the inclusion of a functional multiplayer mode—a feature that many Baldur’s Gate fans will appreciate, given the numerous reports from the past 
                            about the original game's multiplayer being extremely buggy and preventing players from playing with their friends. The EE also brought some new companions along, complete with their 
                            own backstories and personal quests. 
                        </p>

                    <section class="my-4">
                        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                        <p>This game has it all for an RPG; a deep combat and character progression system (D&D 2.5 Edition Rules), excellent writing,
                         well executed open world gameplay, and a varied cast of companions who come from all sides of the cosmic alignment axis.
                         Though its gameplay may seem extremely dated  for modern gamers, it more than makes up for it with its polished content. 
                         Whether you are a veteran RPG enthusiast or a newcomer to the genre, Baldur's Gate II: EE is a must-play that will captivate and challenge you from the very beginning.
